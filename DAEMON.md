The daemon provides devices at `/dev/input/ckb*`, where * is the device number, starting at 1. Up to 9 devices may be connected at once and controlled independently. The daemon additionally provides `/dev/input/ckb0`, which stores driver information.

**Mac note:** The devices on OSX are located at `/var/run/ckb*` and not `/dev/input/ckb*`. So wherever you see `/dev/input` in this document, replace it with `/var/run`.

`/dev/input/ckb0` contains the following files:
- `connected`: A list of all connected devices, one per line. Each line contains a device path followed by the device's serial number and its description.
- `pid`: The process identifier of the daemon.
- `version`: The daemon version.

Other `ckb*` devices contain the following:
- `cmd`: Keyboard controller.
- `notify0`: Keyboard notifications.
- `features`: Device features.
- `fwversion`: Device firmware version (not present on all devices).
- `model`: Device description/model.
- `pollrate`: Poll rate in milliseconds (not present on all devices).
- `serial`: Device serial number. `model` and `serial` will match the info found in `ckb0/connected`

Commands
--------

The `/dev/input/ckb*/cmd` nodes accept input in the form of text commands. They are normally accessible to all users on the system (see Security section). Commands should be given in the following format:
`[mode <n>] command1 [paramter1] [command2] [parameter2] [command3] [parameter3] ...`

In a terminal shell, you can do this like `echo mycommand > /dev/input/ckb1/cmd`. Programmatically, you can open and write them as regular files. When programming, you must append a newline character and flush the output before your command(s) will actually be read.

The `mode` parameter is used to group settings. Most (but not all) settings are mode-specific; that is, changing mode 1 will not affect mode 2. Use `mode <n> switch` to change the current mode.

When plugged in, all devices start in hardware-controlled mode (also known as idle mode) and will not respond to commands. Before issuing any other commands, write `active` to the command node, like `echo active > /dev/input/ckb1/cmd`. To put the device back into hardware mode, issue the `idle` command.

Features
--------

The `features` node describes features supported by the device, which may not be present on all devices. The first two words in the `features` node are always `<vendor> <model>`, like `corsair k70`. After that, any of the following features may appear:
- `bind`: Device supports key rebinding.
- `fwupdate`: Device supports firmware updates.
- `fwversion`: Device has a detectable firmware version (stored in the `fwversion` node).
- `notify`: Device supports key notifications.
- `pollrate`: Device has a detectable poll rate (stored in the `pollrate` node).
- `rgb`: Device supports RGB lighting.

Keyboard layout
---------------

The driver has no concept of keyboard layouts; all keys are referred to by their English names regardless of the underlying hardware. This means that, for instance, in an AZERTY layout the `q` key in ckb-daemon corresponds to A on the physical keyboard. Note that on UK/european layouts, the backslash key (beside left shift) is called `bslash_iso`, while `bslash` refers to the backslash on the US keyboard. The key next to Enter on the UK keyboard is known as `hash`. See `src/ckb-daemon/keymap.c` for the full table of supported keys.

For technical reasons, the OSX driver may swap the `bslash_iso` and `grave` keys if the keyboard layout is not set correctly. To compensate for this, write `layout iso` or `layout us` to the command node. 

Profiles and modes
------------------

Each mode has its own independent binding and lighting setup. When the daemon starts or a keyboard is plugged in, the profile will be loaded from the hardware. By default, all commands will update the currently selected mode. The `mode <n>` command may be used to change the settings for a different mode. Up to 6 modes are available. Each keyboard has one profile, which may be given a name. Mode 1 may be saved to the device hardware, or modes 1-3 in the case of the K95. Modes 4 through 6 are software-only. Profile management commands are as follows:
- `profilename <name>` sets the profile's name. The name must be written without spaces; to add a space, use `%20`.
- `name <name>` sets the current mode's name. Use `mode <n> name <name>` to set a different mode's name.
- `profileid <guid> [<modification>]` sets a profile's ID. The GUID must be written in registry format, like `{12345678-ABCD-EF01-2345-6789ABCDEF01}`. The optional modification number must be written with 8 hex digits, like `ABCDEF01`.
- `id <guid> [<modification>]` sets a mode's ID.
- `mode <n> switch` switches the keyboard to mode N. If the mode does not exist, it will be created with a blank ID, black lighting, and default bindings.
- `hwload` loads the RGB profile from the hardware. Key bindings and non-hardware RGB modes are unaffected.
- `hwsave` saves the RGB profile to the hardware.
- `erase` erases the current mode, resetting its lighting and bindings. Use `mode <n> erase` to erase a different mode.
- `eraseprofile` erases the entire profile, deleting its name, ID, and all of its modes.

**Examples:**
- `profilename My%20Profile mode 1 name Mode%201 mode 2 name Mode%202 mode 3 name Mode%203` will name the profile "My Profile" and name modes 1-3 "Mode 1", "Mode 2", and "Mode 3".
- `eraseprofile hwload` resets the entire profile to its hardware settings.

LED commands
------------

The backlighting is controlled by the `rgb` commands.
- `rgb <RRGGBB>` sets the entire keyboard to the color specified by the hex constant RRGGBB.
- `rgb <key>:<RRGGBB>` sets the specified key to the specified hex color.

**Examples:**
- `rgb ffffff` makes the whole keyboard white.
- `rgb 000000` makes the whole keyboard black.
- `rgb esc:ff0000` sets the Esc key red but leaves the rest of the keyboard unchanged.

Multiple keys may be changed to one color when separated with commas, for instance:
- `rgb w,a,s,d:0000ff` sets the WASD keys to blue.

Additionally, multiple commands may be combined into one, for instance:
- `rgb ffffff esc:ff0000 w,a,s,d:0000ff` sets the Esc key red, the WASD keys blue, and the rest of the keyboard white (note the lack of a key name before `ffffff`, implying the whole keyboard is to be set).

By default, the controller runs at 30 FPS, meaning that attempts to animate the LEDs faster than that will be ignored. If you wish to change it, send the command `fps <n>`. The maximum frame rate is 60.

For devices running in 512-color mode, color dithering can be enabled by sending the command `dither 1`. The command `dither 0` disables dithering.

Indicators
----------

The indicator LEDs (Num Lock, Caps Lock, Scroll Lock) are controlled with the `i` commands.
- `ioff <led>` turns an indicator off permanently. Valid LED names are `num`, `caps`, and `scroll`.
- `ion <led>` turns an indicator on permanently.
- `iauto <led>` turns an indicator off or on automatically (default behavior).

Binding keys
------------

Keys may be rebound through use of the `bind` commands. Binding is a 1-to-1 operation that translates one keypress to a different keypress regardless of circumstance.
- `bind <key1>:<key2>` remaps key1 to key2.
- `unbind <key>` unbinds a key, causing it to lose all function.
- `rebind <key>` resets a key, returning it to its default binding.

**Examples:**
- `bind g1:esc` makes G1 become an alternate Esc key (the actual Esc key is not changed).
- `bind caps:tab tab:caps` switches the functions of the Tab and Caps Lock keys.
- `unbind lwin rwin` disables both Windows keys, even without using the keyboard's Windows Lock function.
- `rebind all` resets the whole keyboard to its default bindings.

Key macros
----------

Macros are a more advanced form of key binding, controlled with the `macro` command.
- `macro <keys>:<command>` binds a key combination to a command, where the command is a series of key presses. To combine keys, separate them with `+`; for instance, `lctrl+a` binds a macro to (left) Ctrl+A. In the command field, enter `+<key>` to trigger a key down or `-<key>` to trigger a key up. To simulate a key press, use `+<key>,-<key>`.
- `macro <keys>:clear` clears commands associated with a key combination. Only one macro may be assigned per combination; assigning a second one will overwrite the first.
- `macro clear` clears all macros.

**Examples:**
- `macro g1:+lctrl,+a,-a,-lctrl` triggers a Ctrl+A when G1 is pressed.
- `macro g2+g3:+lalt,+f4,-f4,-lalt` triggers an Alt+F4 when G2 and G3 are pressed simultaneously.

Assigning a macro to a key will cause its binding to be ignored; for instance, `macro a:+b,-b` will cause A to generate a B character regardless of its binding. However, `macro lctrl+a:+b,-b` will cause A to generate a B only when Ctrl is also held down.

Notifications
-------------

The keyboard can be configured to generate user-readable notifications on keypress events. These are controlled with the `notify` commands. In order to see events, read from `/dev/input/ckb*/notify0`. In a terminal, you can do this like `cat /dev/input/ckb1/notify0`. Programmatically, you can open it for reading like a regular file.

Note that the file can only reliably be read by one application: if you try to open it in two different programs, they may both fail to get data. Data will be buffered as long as no programs are reading, so you will receive all unread notifications as soon as you open the file. If you'd like to read notifications from two separate applications, send the command `notifyon <n>` to the keyboard you wish to receive notifications from, where N is a number between 1 and 9. If `/dev/input/ckb*/notify<n>` does not already exist, it will be created, and you can read notifications from there without disrupting any other program. To close a notification node, send `notifyoff <n>`.

`notify0` is always open and will not be affected by `notifyon`/`notifyoff` commands. By default, all notifications are printed to `notify0`. To print output to a different node, prefix your command with `@<node>`.

Notifications are printed with one notification per line. Commands are as follows:
- `notify <key>:on` or simply `notify <key>` enables notifications for a key. Each key will generate two notifications: `key +<key>` when the key is pressed, and `key -<key>` when it is released.
- `notify <key>:off` turns notifications off for a key.

**Examples:**
- `notify w a s d` sends notifications whenever W, A, S, or D is pressed.
- `notify g1 g2 g3 g4 g5 g6 g7 g8 g9 g10 g11 g12 g13 g14 g15 g16 g17 g18 mr m1 m2 m3 light lock` prints a notification whenever a non-standard key is pressed.
- `notify all:off` turns all key notifications off.
- `@5 notify esc` prints Esc key notifications to `notify5`.

**Note:** Key notifications are _not_ affected by bindings. For instance, if you run `echo bind a:b notify a > /dev/input/ckb1/cmd` and then press the A key, the notifications will read `key +a` `key -a`, despite the fact that the character printed on screen will be `b`. Likewise, unbinding a key or assigning a macro to a key does not affect the notifications.

Getting parameters
------------------

Parameters can be retrieved using the `get` command. The data will be sent out as a notification. Generally, the syntax to get the data associated with a command is `get :<command>` (note the colon), and the associated data will be returned in the form of `<command> <data>`. The following data may be gotten:
- `get :mode` returns the current mode in the form of a `switch` command. (Note: Do not use this in a line containing a `mode` command or it will return the mode that you selected, rather than the keyboard's current mode.)
- `get :name` returns the current mode's name in the form of `mode <n> name <name>`. To see the name of another mode, use `mode <n> get :name`. The name is URL-encoded; spaces are written as %20. The name may be truncated, so `name <some long string> get :name` may return something shorter than what was entered.
- `get :profilename` returns the profile's name, in the form of `profilename <name>`. As above, it is URL-encoded and may be truncated.
- `get :hwname` and `get :hwprofilename` return the same thing except taken from the current hardware profile instead of the in-memory profile. The output is identical but will read `hwname` instead of `name` and `hwprofilename` instead of `profilename`.
- `get :id` returns the current mode's ID and modification number in the form of `mode <n> id <guid> <modification>`.
- `get :profileid` returns the current profile's ID and modification number in the form of `profileid <guid> <modification>`.
- `get :hwid` and `get :hwprofileid` return the same thing except from the current hardware profile/mode. As before, the ouput will be the same but with `hwid` and `hwprofileid` instead of `id` and `profileid`.
- `get :rgb` returns an `rgb` command equivalent to the current RGB state.
- `get :hwrgb` does the same thing, but retrieves the colors currently stored in the hardware profile. The output will say `hwrgb` instead of `rgb`.

Like `notify`, you must prefix your command with `@<node>` to get data printed to a node other than `notify0`.

Firmware updates
----------------

**WARNING:** Improper use of `fwupdate` may brick your device; use this command *at your own risk*. I accept no responsibility for broken keyboards.

The latest RGB keyboard firmwares may be found here:
* K65: http://www3.corsair.com/software/HID/K65RGB.zip
* K70: http://www3.corsair.com/software/HID/K70RGB.zip
* K95: http://www3.corsair.com/software/HID/K95RGB.zip

To update your keyboard's firmware, first extract the contents of the zip file and then issue the command `fwupdate /path/to/fw/file.bin` to the keyboard you wish to update. The path name must be absolute and must not include spaces. If it succeeded, you should see `fwupdate <path> ok` logged to the keyboard's notification node and then the device will disconnect and reconnect. If you see `fwupdate <path> invalid` it means that the firmware file was not valid for the device; more info may be available in the daemon's `stdout`. If you see `fwupdate <path> fail` it means that the file was valid but the update failed at a hardware level. The keyboard may disconnect/reconnect anyway or it may remain in operation.

When the device reconnects you should see the new firmware version in its `fwversion` node; if you see `0000` instead it means that the keyboard did not update successfully and will need another `fwupdate` command in order to function again. If the update fails repeatedly, try connecting the keyboard to a Windows PC and using the official firmware update in CUE.

Security
--------

By default, all of the `ckb*` nodes may be accessed by any user. For most single-user systems this should not present any security issues, since only one person will have access to the computer anyway. However, if you'd like to restrict the users that can write to the `cmd` nodes or read from the `notify` nodes, you can specify the `--gid=<group>` option at start up. For instance, on most systems you could run `ckb-daemon --gid=1000` to make them accessible only by the system's primary user. `ckb-daemon` must still be run as root, regardless of which `gid` you specify. The `gid` option may be set only at startup and cannot be changed while the daemon is running.

The daemon additionally supports a `--nonotify` option to disable key notifications, to prevent unauthorized programs from logging key input. Note that this will interfere with some of `ckb`'s abilities. It is also highly unlikely to increase security unless you are using the program in a stripped down terminal environment without Xorg. For most use cases there are many other (more likely) ways that a keylogger program could compromise your system. Nevertheless, the option is provided for the sake of paranoia. If you'd like to disable key rebinding as well, launch the daemon with `--nobind`. `--nobind` implies `--nonotify`, so notifications will also be disabled. As with `--gid`, these options must be set at startup and cannot be changed while the daemon is running.
